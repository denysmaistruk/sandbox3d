# Sandbox3d
 Welcome to the Sandbox3d project! 
This is a place where we experiment with and showcase the use of popular libraries such as entt, raylib, imgui, imguizmo, and cyclone. The goal of this project is to provide a quick and easy-to-use starting point for those who need a simple editor or game engine with basic and convenient features. Our renderer is powered by raylib, which is a fast and easy-to-use 3D graphics library. We also use imgui and imguizmo for a simple and efficient GUI, and entt and cyclone for entity lifecycle control. This project is a great starting point for those who want to create simple 3D games or applications with a minimum of setup and hassle.
