# Sandbox3d
Welcome to the Sandbox3d project! 

This is a place where I experiment with and showcase the use of popular libraries such as *entt*, raylib, imgui, imguizmo, and cyclone. The goal of this project is to provide a quick and easy-to-use starting point for those who need a simple editor or game engine with basic and convenient features. The renderer is powered by raylib, which is a fast and easy-to-use 2D/3D graphics library. I also use imgui and imguizmo for a simple and efficient GUI and user input, entt for entity lifecycle control and cyclone for physics simulation. This project is a great starting point for those who want to create simple 3D games or applications with a minimum of setup and hassle.
